You can display a 2D NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that you own in your Decentraland scenes. A glowing picture frame will appear around the NFT to certify that you indeed own it.

The NTF's image data is taken from an API, based on the token's contract and id.

Currently, only a limited list of NFTs are supported:

- CriptoKitties
- Axie Infinity
- MyCryptoHeroes
- MLB Champions
- Chibi Fighters
- Blockchain Cuties
- HyperDragons

The picture frame is displayed adjusting to the dimensions of the NFT image. If the image's dimensions are 512 X 512 pixels, the frame keeps its original size. If the image has different dimensions, the frame will be resized and stretched to match these dimensions.

> Tip: If you want to stretch or resize the image from what's generated by default, you can change the `scale` property in the entity's `Transform` component.

> Note: In future versions, when using the `NFTShape` component, the engine will automatically run a verification. The same Ethereum wallet that owns the LAND tokens where the scene is deployed must also own the token. If these addresses don't match, the image won't be displayed in the scene.

## Add an NFT

Add an `NFTShape` component to an entity to display a 2D token in your scene.

```ts
// create entity
const nft = new Entity()

// position entity
nft.addComponent(new Transform({
  position: new Vector3(1, 1.2, 1)
  }))

// add an NFTShape, instanced with a token contract and token id
nft.addComponent(new NFTShape("0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d", "475577"))

// add entity to engine
engine.addEntity(nft)
```

The `NFTShape` component must be instanced with two parameters:

- The _contract_ of the token (for example, the CryptoKitties contract)
- The _id_ of the specific token you own

When the token is displayed, it's shown as having a pulsating frame around it.

You can change the background color of the frame, by changing the `color` property in the `NFTShape`. This affects back side of the model, and also the background of the image in case the NFT image has transparency.

```ts
nft.getComponent(NFTShape()).color = Color3.FromHexString("#ff0000")
```



<!--
## Token certification

When using the `NFTShape` component, the engine automatically runs a verification. The same Ethereum wallet that owns the LAND tokens where the scene is deployed must also own the token.

If you don't own the token, the image isn't displayed in the scene.

This verification is carried out by users loading your scene, every time the entity with the `NFTShape` component is added to the engine.

Above the image of the token, we display a badge that certifies its authenticity. The badge glows in a pulsating pattern, providing a stamp that is difficult to falsify.
